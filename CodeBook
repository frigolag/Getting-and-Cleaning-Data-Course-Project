# Data Introduction
    This project will use six data: x_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt, from the URI HAR Dataset.
    features.txt contains the features from the dataset, which corresponds to each column of x_train.txt and x_test.txt.
    activity_labels.txt contains th type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken, i.e. Walking, walking upstairs, sitting,standing, laying.
    
# Analysis
The R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

- Downloads the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
- Uzips files and loads them into R if they don't already exist in the wd.
- Merges the training and the test data sets to create one unique data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the resulting data set, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

 # Resulting dataset 
 
 The tidy data produced contains 180 observations and 68 variables. The first column is the subject id, second column is the activity and the rest are the average of each feature variables.
